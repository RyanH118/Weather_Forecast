# Weather_Forecast

## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to be able to track weather data from cities and have a history so i can look back on it. I was able to work with server-side APIs to get this done. The goal I wanted to complete was to search for a city and have today's weather displayed in a card in the middle of the screen and then have a 5-day forecast under it with the next five days of weather on it as a set of column cards. I also want to have a history section so when I search for a new city I have the old city as a button that when I click it the city I clicked weather data shows up. I learned what query parameters are and how to use them to get the info I want for my page. I also learned how to get subpoints from the API array to post on a page.
